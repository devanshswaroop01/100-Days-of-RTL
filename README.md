# 🚀 100 Days of RTL Challenge

Hi 👋, I'm **Devansh Swaroop**. I’m diving deep into the world of **VLSI**, focusing on **RTL design using Verilog HDL**. My goal is to master **Register Transfer Level (RTL) design in 100 days** and build a strong foundation in **digital design for FPGAs and ASICs**.

I use tools like **Quartus Prime** and **EDA Playground** for synthesizing, simulating, and validating my designs. These tools help me efficiently develop complex digital circuits and improve my practical RTL skills.

---

## 🎯 Challenge Objective

* Learn and implement RTL design concepts day by day.
* Build small to complex digital circuits, covering **combinational logic, sequential logic, counters, FSMs, memory, arithmetic units, and interfaces**.
* Develop hands-on skills in **simulation, synthesis, and debugging** using professional EDA tools.
* Maintain a clear, day-wise record of progress for reference and portfolio building.
